            <h2>Sumatran Elephant</h2>
            <p>The Sumatran elephant was changed from "endangered" to "critically endangered" because half of its
                population has lost a generation. This decline is mainly due to the loss of habitat and conflicts
                between humans and elephants. </p>

            <p>Today, the Dama Gazelle has become a critically endangered species, and its population is declining. It
                lives in small and scattered groups in Sudan and Chad, with a total population of less than 100. </p>

            <p>Central Africa not only has gorillas, but also the deadly Ebola virus. The Ebola virus killed a large
                number of gorillas and chimpanzees in remote forests in the primate breeding zone. </p>

            <p>Of all the threats faced by black rhinos, poaching is the deadliest. Black rhinos have two horns, which
                makes them a favorable target for illegal trade. </p>

            <h2>Sunda Tiger</h2>
            <p>Due to deforestation and poaching on the island of Sumatra, the survival of the Sunda tiger is under
                strong pressure. It is estimated that there are fewer than 400 individuals left.Even though there has
                been an increased effort to safeguard this animal species, through – among other
                things – stronger law enforcement, there is still a significant market for tiger products in Sumatra and
                other parts of Asia. </p>
