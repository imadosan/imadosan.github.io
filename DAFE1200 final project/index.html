            <h1>Adpot an animal and listen to it's heartbeat</h1>

            <p>Help stop the extinction of animals by "adopting" an endangered animal. Your commitment will make a
                difference.</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <p>You create a user account on this page. Choose an animal you want to "adopt". Pay the donation. The money
                goes to improve the livelihood of the animal you have adopted. Once the transaction has been completed,
                you will have access to a set of features on your profile.</p>

            <p>When you adopt an animal, you will be able to follow the animal in real time via our app! Using modern
                satellite technology, the route the animal takes is tracked and displayed in an interactive map on your
                mobile.</p>

            <p>We also have cutting-edge technology that can measure heart rate using a type of heat-seeking cameras on
                the satellites. This heart rate is recorded and displayed in your app along with several other exciting
                features.</p>

            <p>You will receive regular updates on what the money you have donated is used for, as well as how the
                condition is in the habitat where the animal lives.</p>

            <p>If possible, and if we do not unnecessarily disturb the animal, our volunteer corps will take pictures of
                the animal you have adopted and send them to you. </p>

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

            <p>Earth's wildlife is disappearing at a furious pace. In a cynical world, where the animals' livelihoods
                are at the expense of economic profit, mass extinction of endangered species is imminent.</p>

            <p>Anisave is the animals' advocate. Together we can prevent the degradation of the natural areas where the
                animals live and facilitate the best possible living conditions for these animals. </p>
