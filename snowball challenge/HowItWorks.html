            <p>Our solution to fix this problem is quite simple. We want to use
                drones to locate this plastic. Drones can fly over the ocean surface
                and through a camera, we can see the plastic, and via a GPS we will
                know where the plastic is, and we can procede to go and and pick up the 
                trash with big boats. In the same manner, electrical underwater 'submarine'
                drones can locate plastic that has sinken below the ocean surface. Since 
                it is harder to collect sinken plastic via boat, the 'submarine' drones
                could be built to collect the plastic it selves. This way it will have
                to empty it selves after a while and the process would be longer, but in
                return the process would also be easier.
