            <p>Our long term goal is to make stop global warming. Especially
                we want to stop the constaint polution of the ocean. We love 
                all kinds of animals, from your own dog or cat, to the wanderers
                of the ocean floor and the birds high up in the sky. with todays
                habits, way to much plastic and other harmfull waste end up in the
                ocean, and a lot of marine life suffer as a consequence. According to
                <a title="Plastic in the ocean" href="http://oceancrusaders.org/plastic
                -crusades/plastic-statistics/">Ocean crusaders and National Geographic</a>
                 it is believed that there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in 
                 the ocean. Of that mass, 269,000 tons float on the surface, while some 
                 four billion plastic microfibers per square kilometer litter the deep sea. </p>

        <div class="img-info">
            <h2 id="how">How it works</h2>
            <p>Our solution to fix this problem is quite simple. We want to use
                drones to locate this plastic. Drones can fly over the ocean surface
                and through a camera, we can see the plastic, and via a GPS we will
                know where the plastic is, and we can procede to go and and pick up the 
                trash with big boats. In the same manner, electrical underwater 'submarine'
                drones can locate plastic that has sinken below the ocean surface. Since 
                it is harder to collect sinken plastic via boat, the 'submarine' drones
                could be built to collect the plastic it selves. This way it will have
                to empty it selves after a while and the process would be longer, but in
                return the process would also be easier.
